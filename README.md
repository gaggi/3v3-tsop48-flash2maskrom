# 3v3-tsop48-flash2maskrom
A simple PCB for connecting a cheap and easy available 3v3 TSOP48 Flash Chip (eg. 29AL032) to an SNES Cart in place of the standard 36Pin Maskrom.

For prelashed Chips you can simply close R1 and R2 with solder Blobs or small 0805 Type resistors (preferably 4k7 Ohms or lower) and connect #BYTE to 3v3.
